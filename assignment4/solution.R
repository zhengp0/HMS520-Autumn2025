# Scatter plot ------------------------------------------------------------
# Create a scatter plot with xaxis as the date and y axis as the mr
# * use facet wrap to create subplot for each state
# * specify the number of rows to 10
# * use the scale_y_log10 to plot the y axis in log scale
# * add title "Mortality Rate"
# * save the figure as "mr_by_state_date.png" in 10" by 20".

# * change x axis label to "state" and y axis label to "mortality rate"

# Create a histogram for the mean mr and ifr across states

#   and assignment the result data frame to a variable named `mean_counts`
# * reshape `mean_counts` longer, so that each row is defined by state and

#   data frame to a variable named `mean_counts_long`
# * plot `mean_counts_long` using `geom_histogram`
#   * with two panels one for mortality rate and other for infection fatality
#     rate
#   * scale x axis to log scale
