# HMS520 Autumn 2025
Welcome to HMS520! This repository is used to host all assignments and their
solutions. For each assignment, it will have a folder with name `assignment{i}`,
where `i` is the assignment id. For example `assignment0` will be used for
Assignment 0. Inside each assignment folder, there will be a `README.md`
file to describe the homework, and a `solution.R` file for the solution script.
